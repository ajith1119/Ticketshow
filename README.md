The ticket show application is a web-based system that allows users to view and manage tickets for various events or activities. It is built using the Flask framework, which is a lightweight and flexible web application framework written in Python. The application uses HTML and CSS for the user interface design and SQLAlchemy as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool to interact with the underlying database.

Here's an overview of the functionality of the ticket show application:

This application consists of the 2 users. Here the admin user can manage all the CRUD operations of the venues, shows and tickets. The normal user can view the venues and shows, the user can book the tickets for the specific shows.

The application performs Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on the database using SQLAlchemy. It allows users to add new tickets, retrieve existing tickets, update ticket details, and remove tickets from the database.
